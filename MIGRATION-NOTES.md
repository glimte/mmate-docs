# Migration Notes - Original .NET Docs to Unified Docs

This document tracks what content from the original .NET documentation has been migrated to the unified documentation structure.

## ✅ Successfully Migrated

### Core Components
- ✅ **Contracts** - Message types and interfaces
- ✅ **Messaging** - Publishers, subscribers, and handlers  
- ✅ **StageFlow** - Multi-stage workflow orchestration
- ✅ **Bridge/SyncAsyncBridge** - Synchronous over asynchronous patterns
- ✅ **Interceptors** - Cross-cutting concerns
- ✅ **Schema** - Message validation and versioning (newly added)
- ✅ **Monitoring** - Health checks and metrics

### Documentation
- ✅ **Architecture Overview** - System design and concepts
- ✅ **Getting Started Guides** - Platform-specific quick starts
- ✅ **API References** - Complete API documentation for both platforms
- ✅ **Examples** - Platform-specific code examples
- ✅ **Migration Guides** - .NET to Go and Go to .NET
- ✅ **Wire Format** - Cross-language message specification
- ✅ **Patterns** - Common messaging patterns

### Advanced Topics
- ✅ **Complete Solutions** - Production-ready examples (newly added)
- ✅ **Response Tracking** - Request-response lifecycle (newly added)

## 📝 Key Improvements Made

### 1. Naming Consistency
- Correctly documented that .NET uses `SyncAsyncBridge` while Go uses `Bridge`
- Updated all references to maintain platform-specific naming

### 2. Added Missing Components
- **Schema Component**: Complete documentation for message validation and versioning
- **Complete Solutions**: Production examples from the original docs
- **Response Tracking**: Detailed request-response lifecycle documentation

### 3. Unified Structure
- Consistent structure across both platforms
- Side-by-side code examples for easy comparison
- Clear platform-specific sections

## ⚠️ Still Missing (Lower Priority)

### From Original .NET Docs
1. **Detailed Retry Logic** (`/messaging/retry-logic.md`)
   - Currently covered briefly in reliability section
   - Could be expanded with more patterns

2. **Auto-Acknowledgment Details** (`/messaging/auto-acknowledgment.md`)
   - Basic coverage exists
   - Could add more configuration examples

3. **Circuit Breaker Details** (`/messaging/circuit-breaker.md`)
   - Covered in reliability section
   - Could be expanded with more patterns

4. **StageFlow Advanced Topics**
   - `interceptors-integration.md` - How interceptors work with StageFlow
   - `resilient-workflows.md` - Advanced resilience patterns
   - `workflow-engine.md` - Internal engine details

5. **Schema Generation Tool** (`/schema/schemagen.md`)
   - Tool for generating schemas from code
   - Platform-specific implementation details

## 📚 Documentation Organization

### Original Structure (.NET)
```

├── GETTING-STARTED.md
├── INDEX.md
├── bridge/
├── contracts/
├── examples/
├── interceptors/
├── messaging/
├── monitoring/

```

### New Unified Structure

```

## 🎯 Benefits of New Structure

1. **Cross-Platform Clarity**: Clear separation of platform-specific vs shared concepts
2. **Better Navigation**: Logical grouping of related topics
3. **Comparison Friendly**: Side-by-side examples for both platforms
4. **Migration Support**: Dedicated migration guides in both directions
5. **Production Ready**: Complete solutions and advanced topics

## 🔄 Maintenance Notes

When updating documentation:
1. Update both platform sections if the change affects both
2. Maintain naming consistency (SyncAsyncBridge for .NET, Bridge for Go)
3. Keep examples in sync with actual API signatures
4. Test all code examples to ensure they compile
5. Update migration guides if breaking changes occur
