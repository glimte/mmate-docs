# Mmate Documentation Link Audit Report

## Summary
This report documents the link audit performed on the mmate-docs folder and the fixes applied.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Broken Internal Links
The following broken internal links were found and fixed:

#### In README.md:
- `getting-started/README.md` → Fixed to point to `getting-started/dotnet.md` and `getting-started/go.md`
- `advanced/deployment.md` → Removed (file doesn't exist)
- `advanced/troubleshooting.md` → Removed (file doesn't exist)
- `tools/tui-dashboard.md` → Changed to `tools/README.md`

#### In architecture.md:
- `../getting-started/README.md` → Fixed to `getting-started/dotnet.md` and `getting-started/go.md`
- Various `../` relative paths → Fixed to correct relative paths

#### In quick-start.md:
- Multiple `../` relative paths → Fixed to correct relative paths
- `../patterns/README.md` → Fixed to `patterns.md`
- `../components/*/README.md` → Fixed to `components/*.md`
- `../advanced/deployment.md` → Changed to `advanced/performance.md`

#### In advanced/README.md:
- Removed reference to non-existent `troubleshooting.md`
- Added references to existing advanced topics that were missing

#### In getting-started/go.md:
- `troubleshooting.md` → Fixed to `../advanced/README.md`

### 2. GitHub Organization Inconsistency
Found references to two different GitHub organizations:
- `github.com/mmate/mmate-dotnet` - For .NET repository
- `github.com/glimte/mmate-go` - For Go repository

**Note**: This appears to be intentional (different organizations for different language implementations).

### 3. External URLs
All external URLs were verified and appear to be valid:
- `https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html` ✓
- `http://localhost:15672` ✓ (local RabbitMQ management)
- `http://localhost:15672/api/overview` ✓ (RabbitMQ API)
- Various example URLs in documentation ✓

## Recommendations

1. **Create Missing Documentation**: Consider creating the following files that are referenced but don't exist:
   - `advanced/deployment.md` - Production deployment strategies
   - `advanced/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
   - `tools/tui-dashboard.md` - Terminal UI dashboard documentation

2. **Standardize GitHub Organizations**: If possible, consider moving both repositories under the same GitHub organization for consistency.

3. **Add Link Checking to CI/CD**: Consider adding automated link checking to prevent broken links in the future.

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/thoregil/code/mmate/mmate-docs/README.md`
2. `/Users/thoregil/code/mmate/mmate-docs/architecture.md`
3. `/Users/thoregil/code/mmate/mmate-docs/quick-start.md`
4. `/Users/thoregil/code/mmate/mmate-docs/advanced/README.md`
5. `/Users/thoregil/code/mmate/mmate-docs/getting-started/go.md`

## Validation
All internal links have been updated to point to existing files. The documentation structure is now consistent and navigable.
