## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start with reliability** - Build fault tolerance from the beginning
2. **Monitor everything** - You can't improve what you don't measure
3. **Test thoroughly** - Include failure scenarios in testing
4. **Security first** - Don't add security as an afterthought
5. **Document operations** - Make your system maintainable
